# rn-jukebox

Welcome to rn-jukebox! This React Native project powered by Expo allows users to search for songs and add them to a playlist. Another device can listen for updates to a Firebase database where the playlist is stored and play the songs as they come. If there are no songs in the queue, the second device will play songs of the default genre associated with the playlist.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the rn-jukebox app, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Firebase console account

   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   };
   ```
